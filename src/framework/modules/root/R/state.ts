/*
 -- Immutable.js records are an awesome addition to your app. Why?
 + They're self-documenting. Any developer will be able to see all the fields within a resource/record
 + They enforce strict code quality. You can't add undocumented fields to a record.
 + They combine the benefits of ImmutableJS' Map() with normal JS objects. They have standard accessors (post.name vs post.get('name')), you can use
 destructuring, and they have Immutable's strict equality. You can use getIn within maps and records. If a map contains records you can read
 record's values using getIn.
